# Dependency Injection (DI)

## Definition:
A set of software design principles and patterns that enable us to develop loosely coupled code.

Benefits of loose coupling:
* Code easier to extend and functionality can be added without making changes to all of our objects
* Code easier to test as pieces of functionality can be isolated and can be used for short, easy-to-read unit tests
